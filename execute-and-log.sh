set -euo pipefail  # Enable strict error handling

# `set -euo pipefail` a commonly used safety measure in shell scripting that helps catch errors early and prevents silent failures. Hereâ€™s what each flag does:
# `-e` (Exit on Error)
#
#   Causes the script to exit immediately if any command fails (returns a non-zero exit code).
#   This helps prevent the script from continuing execution after an error, which could lead to unintended behavior.
#
# `-u` (Unset Variables Treated as Errors)
#   Treats unset variables as errors and causes the script to fail if it tries to use one.
#   This prevents issues caused by typos or missing variables.
#
# `-o` pipefail (Fail Pipeline on Error)
#
#   By default, in a pipeline (cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3), only the exit status of the last command is considered.
#   With pipefail, if any command in the pipeline fails, the entire pipeline fails.
#
# Why Use set -euo pipefail?
#   Ensures fail-fast behavior: If a command fails, the script exits immediately instead of continuing with potential errors.
#   Catches unintended issues, like unset variables.
#   Helps debug pipelines where errors might otherwise be ignored.
