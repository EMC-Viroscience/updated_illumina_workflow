set -euo pipefail  # Enable strict error handling

"""
`set -euo pipefail` a commonly used safety measure in shell scripting that helps catch errors early and prevents silent failures. Hereâ€™s what each flag does:

`-e` (Exit on Error)

  Causes the script to exit immediately if any command fails (returns a non-zero exit code).
  This helps prevent the script from continuing execution after an error, which could lead to unintended behavior.

`-u` (Unset Variables Treated as Errors)
  Treats unset variables as errors and causes the script to fail if it tries to use one.
  This prevents issues caused by typos or missing variables.

`-o` pipefail (Fail Pipeline on Error)

  By default, in a pipeline (cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3), only the exit status of the last command is considered.
  With pipefail, if any command in the pipeline fails, the entire pipeline fails.

*Why Use set -euo pipefail?*
  Ensures fail-fast behavior: If a command fails, the script exits immediately instead of continuing with potential errors.
  Catches unintended issues, like unset variables.
  Helps debug pipelines where errors might otherwise be ignored.
